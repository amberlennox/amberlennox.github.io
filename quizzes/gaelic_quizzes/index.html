<b>Gaelic</b> is a minority language indigenous to Scotland and closely related to Irish and Manx. Through the Celtic language family, it is also (more distantly) related to Welsh, Cornish and Breton. It is distinct from <b>Scots</b>, another minority language native to Scotland.<br><br>
I have been learning Gaelic for a short time, and it was because of the relatively small number of interactive activities available online that I chose to create some of my own quizzes (based random word/image generators) to improve my recollection of Gaelic words.
<br><br>
My quizzes aim to build quick recall of general vocabulary in simple topics. Because many studies have discouraged learning through translation, I have avoided using English prompts wherever possible, and instead base my questions on images or the Gaelic language itself. In every case I include a "cheat sheet" or language key at the bottom of the page which defines the correct answers as I have programmed them.<br><br>
Please note that I am <b>not</b> a native speaker of Gaelic, nor do I hold any qualification to teach Gaelic. I make every effort to check my quizzes for errors against authoritative sources (primarily the LearnGaelic dictionary) but I cannot promise that I always use the most common or most natural word for a native speaker. I am simply a learner sharing my home-made memorization aids, and my quizzes are limited by the vocabulary I have encountered. I encourage you to check my quizzes against dictionaries or other resources yourself, and please contact me at arelennox@gmail.com if you have corrections or suggestions. (I have no desire to contribute to the volume of poorly translated Gaelic resources on the web.) <br><br>My quizzes should only be used to supplement other resources made by native and fluent speakers. To that end, I recommend <a href="https://learngaelic.net/">LearnGaelic</a>, <a href="https://www.taic.me.uk/">Taic</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9QhuYhWNaOkzKXz8XSzAXQ">Gàidhlig Gu Leòr</a>, <a href="https://speakgaelic.scot/?lang=gd">Speak Gaelic</a>, <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/enroll/gd/en/Learn-Scottish%20Gaelic">DuoLingo</a> and <a href="https://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/">Sabhal Mòr Ostaig</a> as reputable locations to learn the Gaelic language. <br><br>
