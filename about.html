Hello! Welcome to my little corner of the web.<br><br>
I'm a Scottish developer slash scientist, currently chasing my PhD in Physics in the US of A. My focus is on Cosmology, studying the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), AKA: baby pics of the universe! I get to work with telescopes, observe the earliest measurable light emitted after the Big Bang, and analyze the heck out of it!
<br><br>
I'm not just a physics nerd, though - I'm also a language geek. I struggled with French in school, but I struggled a lot with pronunciation and this gave me the (false!) impression that I was bad at languages. Later in life I look Gaelic lessons, and I fell in love with the culture, community and identity that is produced through language. Now I'm a proud learner of Gaelic and a big advocate language learning, particularly for minority languages. I found gameification apps, like Duolingo, really helped with my learning style. Since I like building digital creations, I experimented with some cool interactive quizzes to help with vocabulary, which you can check out on this website.
<br><br>
When I'm not nerding out over physics or languages, I'm snapping pics of birds in nature. You can find some of my favorite shots on this website. I love playing ice hockey, swimming and climbing too.
<br><br>
Oh, and did I mention I used to be in a folk metal band? Yup, I even founded <a href="https://www.musicglue.com/northofthewallfestival/">a music festival</a> back in the day!
<br><br>
This website is my passion project, and it's all free for you to enjoy. Just give me a shout if you find anything useful, and if you're feeling generous, make a donation to <a href="https://www.refuweegee.co.uk/your-donations">Refuweegee</a>. Cheers!
