Hello! Welcome to my little corner of the web.<br><br>
I'm from Scotland originally, and I'm a PhD student studying Physics in the United States. Specifically, my area of research is Cosmology, and I work on telescopes observing the Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB, which is the earliest measurable light emitted not long after the Big Bang. In other words, I look at baby pictures of the universe!
<br><br>
I studied French at school, but I struggled a lot with pronunciation and this gave me the (false!) impression that I was bad at languages. Later in life I look Gaelic lessons, and I fell in love with the culture, community and identity that is produced through language. I'm now a big advocate language learning, particularly for minority languages. Furthermore, I found gameification apps, like Duolingo, really helped with my learning style, and since I've always enjoyed coding myself, I began creating my own interactive quizzes to improve vocabulary, which you can find on this website. 
<br><br>
Something else I love is photography, especially nature photography, so you can view many of my amateur shots over the years. You'll see a lot of birds.
<br><br>
 Oh, and once upon a time I was in a folk metal band and actually founded <a href="https://www.musicglue.com/northofthewallfestival/">a music festival</a>.
<br><br>
This website is a passion project, and I'm not a big fan of monetisation for the sake of it, so everything here is free to use. All I ask is that you let me know, and make a donation to <a href="https://www.refuweegee.co.uk/your-donations">Refuweegee</a> if you use any of my materials often.
