 <center>  <b><br><br> I was given a camera few years ago and I like using it.</b><br><br> 
Pictures are free to use for personal projects if you see anything you like. Let me know if you do, it would give me the warm fuzzies. Actual photographers are always welcome to give me advice.<p> I use a Panasonic DMC-FZ72 and I mostly like photographing animals and nature. One day, I would like to get into astrophotography when I can get the equipment.<br><br>
